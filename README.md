# Assignment Activity 1
## Summary of Assignment Activity 1

The assignment activity involved data manipulation and analysis using a dataset from `turtle_reviews.csv`, which encompasses various customer details and product reviews. Essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Sklearn facilitated the data exploration, cleaning, and subsequent regression analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Management
The data underwent a thorough cleaning process, including handling missing values, renaming columns, and dropping unnecessary variables, after which the refined data was saved as `reviews_cleaned.csv`.

### Regression Analysis Insights
An OLS regression model offered notable insights, explaining 84% of the variance in customer loyalty points through variables like age, remuneration, and spending score, all of which were statistically significant.

### Observations and Further Exploration
Nevertheless, the assignment partially overlooked the potential of data visualisation and may benefit from a deeper exploration of other variables and potentially leveraging other statistical methods.

#### Exploring Text Data through NLP
A noteworthy area for further exploration includes diving into text data via Natural Language Processing (NLP) to glean more insights into customer sentiments from their reviews, thereby possibly unearthing additional variables that could influence and predict loyalty points and customer behaviour. This additional layer of analysis could elevate the predictive modelling and provide a richer understanding of customer behaviour and preferences.

## Summary of Assignment Activity 2

## Overview:

The analysis aimed to explore correlations and segmentations within the customer base regarding remuneration and spending scores, using k-means clustering to provide actionable insights to the marketing department.

### Data Insights:

1. **Correlation Insight:** Visual inspection revealed a moderate correlation between remuneration and spending scores. Higher-income often correlated with higher spending, but exceptions existed.

2. **Cluster Identification:** The Elbow and Silhouette methods determined an optimal cluster solution with 'k' clusters. This segmentation unveiled customer groups with distinct remuneration and spending patterns.

3. **Customer Segments Characteristics:** Key segments included high earners with high/low spending and low earners with high/low spending, vital for tailored marketing strategies.

4. **Utility of Scores:** Remuneration and spending scores proved beneficial in creating actionable segments. Each cluster represented unique combinations of these variables, revealing varying spending behaviors.

5. **Cluster Size and Consistency:** Varying cluster sizes indicated non-uniform data distribution. Some clusters were densely populated, while others were sparse, suggesting underserved or oversaturated market segments.

### Analytical Reflections:

The analysis uncovered segmentation and correlations, but cluster size disparities hint at unexplored nuances. Tailored marketing strategies for each cluster will maximize the potential of this segmentation, ensuring optimal resource allocation and leveraging insights effectively.
