# Assignment Activity 1
## Summary of Assignment Activity

The assignment predominantly involved extensive data manipulation and analysis using a dataset from `turtle_reviews.csv`, which encompasses various customer details and product reviews. Essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Sklearn facilitated the data exploration, cleaning, and subsequent regression analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Management
The data underwent a thorough cleaning process, including handling missing values, renaming columns, and dropping unnecessary variables, after which the refined data was saved as `reviews_cleaned.csv`.

### Regression Analysis Insights
An OLS regression model offered notable insights, explaining 84% of the variance in customer loyalty points through variables like age, remuneration, and spending score, all of which were statistically significant.

### Observations and Further Exploration
Nevertheless, the assignment partially overlooked the potential of data visualisation and may benefit from a deeper exploration of other variables and potentially leveraging other statistical methods.

#### Exploring Text Data through NLP
A noteworthy area for further exploration includes diving into text data via Natural Language Processing (NLP) to glean more insights into customer sentiments from their reviews, thereby possibly unearthing additional variables that could influence and predict loyalty points and customer behaviour. This additional layer of analysis could elevate the predictive modelling and provide a richer understanding of customer behaviour and preferences.
